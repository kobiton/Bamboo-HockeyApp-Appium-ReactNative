## 1. Setup Bamboo

### Installation

Download Bamboo from https://www.atlassian.com/software/bamboo. Follow their [installation guide](https://confluence.atlassian.com/bamboo/getting-started-with-bamboo-289277283.html?_ga=2.95849887.246880307.1531709232-1995250601.1528082340). 

### Create a project and link to GitHub

Setup your first project. You may reference [this guideline](https://www.360logica.com/blog/how-to-create-and-run-your-first-project-in-bamboo/) for more details. 

Now that you have created a project and plan, you can now start configuring tasks. In the [next guideline](running-automation-testing.md), we will configure tasks that will allow us to run an automation test with Kobiton.
